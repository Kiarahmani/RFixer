Given the regular expression:

  ((((\d){1,3})(,(\d){3})*)|((\d)+))(.(\d)+)?

That that should match the strings:

  ✓ (0:7)    9999999
  ✓ (7:18)   99999.99999
  ✓ (18:33)  99,999,999.9999
  ✓ (33:46)  123,456,789.9
  ✓ (46:60)  954,652,000.03

And reject the strings:

  ✗ (60:65)  9999.
  ✗ (65:79)  9,99,99999.999
  ✗ (79:92)  999.9999.9999
  ✗ (92:101) 100,000,0
  ✗ (101:107) 100,00
  ✗ (107:117) 200,999,00
