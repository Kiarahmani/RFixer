Given the regular expression:

  ((\d|,))*(\d)+

That that should match the strings:

  ✓ (0:3)    123
  ✓ (3:4)    4
  ✓ (4:9)    1,234
  ✓ (9:18)   1,234,567
  ✓ (18:24)  23,456

  ✓ (56:65)  3,546,799
  ✓ (65:72)  333,333

And reject the strings:

  ✗ (72:76)  1234
  ✗ (76:82)  1234.0
  ✗ (82:87)  -1234
  ✗ (87:92)  $1234
