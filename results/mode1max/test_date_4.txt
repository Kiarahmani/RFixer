Given the regular expression:

  ((0[1-9])|(1[0-2]))\/((\d){4})

That that should match the strings:

  ✓ (0:7)    12/2002
  ✓ (7:14)   11/1900
  ✓ (14:21)  02/1977
  ✓ (21:27)  2/1977
  ✓ (27:33)  5/2002

And reject the strings:

  ✗ (33:39)  0/2003
  ✗ (39:46)  13/2002
  ✗ (46:51)  12/02
  ✗ (51:58)  15/1900
  ✗ (58:68)  10/10/1977
  ✗ (68:75)  12-2002
  ✗ (75:82)  2002/12
