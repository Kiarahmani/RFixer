 – 
) was an English-born actor, pilot and restaurateur who is probably best known for playing John Strangways, the character who uttered the first dialogue in the first [[James Bond]] film \u0022[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]\u0022, and was the first character to die in the film series.\n\nTimothy Moxon is mentioned and quoted in British historian Matthew Parker's Random House 2014 book:\n \u0022Goldeneye: Where James Bond Was Born: Ian Fleming's Jamaica.\u0022  \n\nTimothy Moxon was interviewed in 2005 in Jamaica by Lee Pfeiffer, editor-in-chief of Cinema Retro Magazine for the Movie Classics special edition of The First James Bond  Film - Dr. No.  See pages 28 - 29.\n\n==Early life and career==\nMoxon was born in [[Kent]], [[England]] and served in the [[Royal Air Force]] in the [[Second World War]], training as a pilot in [[Canada]], and flying aircraft that towed troop-carrying gliders across occupied Europe. After the war he acted in repertory theatre and, with his brother [[Oliver Moxon]], founded the New Torch Theatre, London. He was also a pilot with [[British European Airways|BEA]], and for an agricultural [[crop spraying]] company in [[Sudan]] and [[Jamaica]], where he remained for the rest of his life, settling in [[Oracabessa]].\nTim also was a pilot for Reynolds Metals Co. in British Guiana (now Guyana ) during the early 1960s, flying in and out of Kwakwani, while also living there.\n\n==\u0022Dr. No\u0022==\nHe was working as a crop dusting pilot when he had a chance meeting at the Courtleigh Manor Hotel in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], with the director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], who remembered him as an actor on the London stage. Young offered him a small role at the start of the film, as a British agent who leaves a card game to take a phone call, and is murdered by three assassins posing as blind men. It transpires that the character was killed, because he was investigating the activities of the villainous Dr. No, and revealed this to his friend Professor Dent, who was secretly working for No.\nIn 1967, he had a role in another film shot in the Caribbean entitled \u0022[[Come Spy with Me (film)|Come Spy With Me]]\u0022, and in his later years he appeared in local theatre productions, in a documentary film entitled \u0022Inside Dr. No\u0022 and at James Bond fan events where he signed autographs.\n\n==Later life==\nHe founded the Jamaican charter airline [[TimAir]], and ran a hotair balloon business for tourists. He opened the popular HouseBoat Fondue Restaurant in [[Montego Bay]], and performed in many plays with his partner Norma at Montego Bay theatre. He died aged 82 in 2006, leaving a son and two daughters.\n\n==Partial filmography==\n*\u0022[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]\u0022 (1962) - John Strangways (uncredited)\n*\u0022[[Come Spy with Me (film)|Come Spy with Me]]\u0022 (1967) - Morgan (final film role)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|id=0610319|name=Timothy Moxon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moxon, Timothy}}\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:English male film actors]]\n[[Category:English aviators]]\n[[Category:British restaurateurs]]\n[[Catego

The \u0022'Colegio San José\u0022' is a private, co-educational, Roman Catholic college preparatory school located in the city of [[San Germán, Puerto Rico]].\n\n== History ==\nThe school in its present form was founded in 1930 by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] (\u0022hermanas Josefinas\u0022 in Spanish) who came to San Germán from Brentwood, New York, originally as an all-girls school. However, [[Sisters of Charity|The Sisters of Charity]] were the first in opening a school in the structure- they established the Colegio para Señoritas de la Inmaculada Concepción, another all-girls school which functioned from 1913 to 1927. The Sister’s of St. Joseph were responsible for running all aspects of the school until their departure in 2007. Since then, the school is directed by a [[Head teacher|principal]], an administrative director, and a board of regents appointed by the [[diocese of Mayaguez|bishop of Mayagüez]], currently [[Álvaro Corrada del Río]]. The Convent is no longer inhabited by any religious orders.\n\nOn 
 the contract for the creation of the Alliance for Catholic Education (Alianza Pro Educación Católica) was signed on a formal activity within the school itself. The Alliance is a joint venture between the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico]], [[Schoenstatt Movement|The Apostolic Movement of Schoenstatt]], and the Colegio for the reinforcement of spiritual, academic, social and moral values for the renovation of the school. This new school policy has been denominated: \u0022La nueva primavera\u0022, which literally translates as \u0022The New Spring\u0022.\n\n\nBefore its use as a school, the older buildings were home to missionaries from 1878 to 1898 and served as a convent for [[Carmelites|The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (i.e., Carmelites) from 1903 to 1913.\n\n== Facilities ==\n\u0022'Colegio San José\u0022' is located on top of the highest hill of the historical city of [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]], the \u0022Loma de Santa Clara\u0022 (the Hill of St. Clare).\n\nAs you approach \u0022'Colegio San José\u0022' on the corner of Estrella and Victoria streets, three divisions are clearly visible in the south façade: the former Hermitage of St. Sebastian at the center, the old Carmelite Convent to its right, and a new building which houses the primary grades (K-3rd grade) of the school to the left. The latter was built following the architectural design of the old convent so as to not detract from the historical value of the building. In front of the old structure stands the statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]], patron saint of the school.\n\nThe Hermitage of St. Sebastian was built in 1737, and served as the city’s parish church at times when the official parish church of [[Church San Germán de Auxerre|San Germán de Auxerre]] was unavailable for worship. The Hermitage’s original altar now stands in the church of [[Porta Coeli (Puerto Rico)|Porta Coeli]], also in San Germán, one of the oldest churches in the Western Hemisphere. Presently, the Hermitage of St. Sebastian functions as the school's library.\n\nIn 1878 the Convent now located to the right of the old Hermitage (if seen from the south) was added on to serve as a seminary, but this was never so. Before the Sister’s of Joseph arrived, the buildings were inhabited by a number of religious orders, including [[Franciscan]] monks, [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptionist]] monks, [[Augustinians|Augustine]] monks, Carmelitas, and Sister’s of Charity. The Convent housed the Sister's of St. Joseph from 1930 to 2007 and it is now vacant. A number of administrative offices and meeting halls are located in the Convent, and it serves as the primary entrance from the historical façade on the south side of campus and provides access to the Hermitage and library.\n\nThree buildings were added to the north of the south façade buildings to create a quadrangle that is the heart of the school. The eastern building houses grades 4 through 6 and

The [[DVD]] was released on 
 by [[Warner Home Video]].\n\n==Plot==\nScooby-Doo and the gang travel to Atlantic City, where Fred enthusiastically takes them to see The Brancusi Circus. They arrive to find that the circus does not open until tomorrow, but decide to look around when they notice that the front door is unlocked. Whilst searching, they meet a man who is pursuing a [[werewolf]] that has intruded into the circus. The werewolf attacks the gang, but is eventually scared off by Velma, using a spotlight. The man thanks the gang and introduces himself as Marius Brancusi, the ringleader. Marius inherited the circus from his uncle last year and has been working to modernize it. He informs the gang that the werewolf they had encountered has been shadowing the circus for a few months, has scared off many of his artists, and has stolen jewelry wherever they are. He even suspects that the werewolf might be one of his own artists. Velma notices that this incident alludes to a case during the 18th century, in Ingolstadt, where a werewolf named Hans collected a combination of jewels which enabled him to change into a werewolf at any time. After the gang tells Marius that they solve mysteries, Marius hires them to go undercover as circus performers.\n\nThe next morning, Marius introduces the gang to the other circus artists. Scooby and Shaggy pose as animal artists and team up with animal trainer Whitney Doubleday, who informs them that Marius plans to eliminate all the animal acts in order to modernize the circus. Velma is given a role as a human cannonball and works with strong man Archambault. Fred is given a position as a backup trapeze artist and meets the other trapeze artist, Oliverio, and his girlfriend Lena. Oliverio immediately becomes jealous of Fred when Lena begins to flirt with him. Daphne works as a motorcycle stunt artist and meets the circus clowns, Schmatko and Sisko. Sisko only communicates with a horn. Schmatko tells Daphne that he is reluctant to have this role as a clown, and says that he was once an actor in the Soviet Union. Afterwards, when Schmatko goes to get refreshments, he is abducted by the werewolf.\n\nLater on the gang witness another robbery by the werewolf and are chased by a second werewolf wearing Schmatko's uniform. The gang escape and return to the circus to inform Marius. Despite this, Marius decides that the show must go on. Daphne fills in for Schmatko, while Fred does a tightrope act to fill in time. The shows goes very well, especially Scooby's act, although Shaggy takes credit for Scooby's performance when he tells the audience that he's Scooby's 'trainer'. Before Velma can perform her act, the two werewolves attack Shaggy and Scooby. Fred and Marius manage to drop the trapeze safety net on them, but werewolves are nowhere to be found when they search the net. In spite of the attack, the performers receive a big round of applause from the audience, who believe that the werewolves were just part of the show.\n\nThe next day, Marius s

The [[ballad]] was written by [[Diane Warren]], with production handled by [[David Foster]], and was recorded by Norwood for her second [[studio album]], \u0022[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]\u0022 (1998). It was released as the album's third single during the fall of [[1998 in music|1998]] and became Norwood's second song to reach the top position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\u0022Billboard\u0022 Hot 100]] following the worldwide number-one success of \u0022[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]\u0022. The song also reached number one in New Zealand, peaked within the top ten in Australia, and managed to reach the top 20 in Canada and the United Kingdom, and top 30 in Ireland.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by [[Kevin Bray (director)|Kevin Bray]], depicts Norwood looking after the empty house of her best friend, whom she is secretly in love with, waiting for his return while watching videos of the two of them. At the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|1999 ceremony]], the video was nominated an [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video]] but eventually lost to [[Lauryn Hill]]'s \u0022[[Doo Wop (That Thing)]]\u0022.\n\n==Development and recording==\n\u0022Have You Ever?\u0022 was written by [[Diane Warren]] and was produced by [[David Foster]]. While Norwood had worked with a wide range of different producers on previous tracks for her debut album \u0022[[Brandy (album)|Brandy]]\u0022 (1994) and several soundtrack contributions, the recording of the song marked the first time she \u0022had been in the studio with a producer like David Foster\u0022, Norwood stated in a 2005 interview. \u0022My voice wasn't as developed as it is now and the song required what producers call ‘money notes' - the kind that get you a No. 1 on the charts! I was really nervous but it all worked just fine.\u0022 On 
, Warren revealed in an interview that she considers the track \u0022a classic song. She sang it amazingly. I’m still waiting for the country version.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe song received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics upon its release. In his single review for \u0022[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\u0022, journalist [[Chuck Taylor (journalist)|Chuck Taylor]] noted that it was hard \u0022to imagine this single as anything but another jewel in the pop/R&B princess' crown.\u0022 He called that the melody \u0022instantly gratifying, with a harmony-soaked hook that's dedicted to memory

However, due to reorganization of the church, the ecclesiastical parish no longer exists, having been subsumed into the parish of Rathdowney in the [[Diocese of Cashel and Ossory]].\n\nThe  [[historian]], [[antiquary]] and [[topographer]], [[Edward Ledwich]] was a [[vicar]] of the Church of Ireland parish; he was appointed in 1772 and must have resigned in 1797 as his successor was appointed in that year.\n\n==Early Irish church==\n\nIn the early Irish church, a parish was an ecclesiastical unit of territory based on the Gaelic territorial unit called a \u0022[[túath]]\u0022 or on early Christian and monastic settlements.\nIn the case of Aghaboe, the parish seems based on the ministry of the early mediaeval [[Abbey of Aghaboe]], whose [[Irish language]] name, \u0022Achadh Bhó\u0022,  means \u0022Ox's Field\u0022.\n\n==Townlands==\n\nThe townlands that make up the parish are:\n{{colbegin||15em}}\n*[[Aghaboe (townland)|Aghaboe]]\n*Anster\n*Ardvarney\n*Ballybrophy\n*Ballycolla Town\n*Ballycuddahy\n*Ballygarvan Glebe\n*Ballygeehin Lower\n*Ballygeehin Upper\n*Ballygowdan\n*Ballyhinode\n*Ballykeevan\n*Ballyowen\n*Ballyreilly\n*Barnasallagh\n*Baunbrack\n*Baunoge\n*Boherard\n*Borris-in-Ossory Town\n*Bushfield\n*Cappagh\n*Carrowreagh\n*Chapelhill\n*Coolbally\n*Coolfin\n*Corraun\n*Cross\n*Cruell\n*Cuffsborough\n*Dairyhill\n*Delligabaun\n*Derrin\n*Derrinoliver\n*Derrinsallagh\n*Derryvorrigan\n*Doon\n*Farraneglish Glebe\n*Fearagh\n*Friarsland\n*Garryduff\n*Gortnaclea\n*Gortnagroagh\n*Grange Beg\n*Grange More\n*Grantstown\n*Keelough Glebe\n*Kilbeg\n*Kilcotton\n*Kildellig\n*Kilminfoyle\n*Kilnaseer\n*Knockamullin\n*Knockaroe\n*Knockfin\n*Knockkyle\n*Knockseera\n*Kyletilloge\n*Leap\n*Legaun\n*Lismore\n*Maghernaskeagh\n*[[Middlemount (townland)|Middlemount]]\n*Moanfad\n*Oldglass\n*Palmershill\n*Park\n*Sentryhill\n*Shanboe\n*Skeagh\n*Springfield\n*Tinnaragh\n*Tinnaraheen\n*Tintore\n*Tooreagh\n*Townparks\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n{{coord missing|County Offaly}}\n\n[[Category:Civil parishes of County Offaly]]</text>\n      <sha1>0fs6lbkmkyi0krgzxn1vsbwfxs8ijy2</sha1>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Qaleh-ye Khalili</title>\n    <ns>0</ns>\n    <id>37185496</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>772861582</id>\n      <parentid>765317989</parentid>\n      <timestamp>

Unknown to the Comandante, scientist Don Panchito is responsible for the murders and has been murdering the athletic community in order to provide test subjects for his experiments; Panchito’s procedure involves removing the victim’s brain and replacing it with that of an animal’s in an effort to find a way to conquer death.\n\nDesperate to solve the murders, Robles enlists the help of wrestler Guillermo Santana ([[Wolf Ruvinskis]]) who acts as bait in order to catch the murderer. However, the trap goes awry and Santana is captured and murdered by Panchito who then removes his brain and replaces it with the brain of a [[gorilla]]. Unlike many of Panchito’s other victims, Santana survives the procedure but as a result is transformed into a grotesque and bestial state that seems to have taken on several characteristics of that of an ape. Covering his now horrifying vestige with a mask, Panchito sends Santana into the wrestling ring. However, during the fight Santana’s animal side takes over and overrides Panchito’s programming, ripping off his mask and exposing his hideously deformed face. Santana finds Panchito and slaughters him and then kidnaps Lucía, the woman he loved while he was human and flees on the rooftops with the police in pursuit, setting Lucía down, Santana moves to attack the police but is gunned down by Robles and falls the rooftop to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Columba Domínguez]] as Lucía\n* [[Crox Alvarado]] as Capt. Carlos Robles\n* [[Wolf Ruvinskis]] as Guillermo Santana / El Vampiro\n* [[Carlos Riquelme]] as Don Panchito / The Mad Doctor\n* [[Arturo Martínez (actor)|Arturo Martínez]] as Felipe Dorantes\n* [[Guillermo Hernández (actor)|Guillermo Hernández]] as El Lobo\n* [[Yerye Beirute]] as Cosme Ramírez\n* [[Alejandro Cruz]] as El Tigre\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Development===\nThe story for \u0022Ladrón de Cadáveres\u0022 was partially inspired by Universal’s [[Frankenstein|Frankenstein (1931 film)]] which was a commercial and critical success. Hoping to replicate this success, Mexican directors responded by releasing their own variations of [[Universal Studios]] famous [[Universal Monsters|monster movies]], but differed enough to avoid any copyright lawsuits.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in [[Mexico]] on 
 and was later released in other countries several years later in Japan in 1958, and in West Germany and Austria in 1958 and 1959 respectively.<ref name=\u0022The Body Snatcher 1957 - IMDb\u0022>{{cite web|title=The Body Snatcher (1957) - IMDb|

It was released first in arcades, followed by home ports for the [[Sega Saturn]] in Japan, and later for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in all regions.\n\nCapitalizing on the success of [[Sega]]'s \u0022[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]\u0022 fighting game series at the time, \u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 takes influence from \u0022Virtua Fighter\u0022 while adding unique gameplay elements of its own. The game also attracted attention for its presentation, which was more provocative than other mainstream 3D fighting games at the time.\n\n\u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 was a commercial success, helping Tecmo overcome their financial problems. The success of the game helped turn the series into a franchise, including several sequels and numerous spinoffs.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay of \u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 was unique at the time of its debut because it featured different choices in gameplay than other early [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[fighting game]]s. Its most defining features were its speed and countering system. \u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 put an emphasis on speed, and relied more on simplistic commands and quick reaction time.\n\nFurthermore, its countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that corresponded to each type of attack. There are two kinds of holds, an Offensive Hold and a Defensive Hold; the latter are executed by holding back or forward on the directional pad along with the guard input to either force away or counter-damage an opponent.\n\nThe game also introduced an environmental system of the \u0022Danger Zones\u0022 that surround the outer edges of the fighting arena (depending on the options, it can also completely consume it) and can send an affected character in the air so the opposing player can execute a juggling air [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]. However, this can be avoided with a defensive roll.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Characters===\n{{see also|List of Dead or Alive characters#Introduced in Dead or Alive}}\n\n*[[Bayman]], a Russian mercenary\n*[[Gen Fu]], an old Chinese martial arts master\n*[[Jann Lee]], a Chinese fighter modeled on [[Bruce Lee]]\n*[[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]], a Japanese female ninja who is the series' main protagonist\n*[[Leifang]], a young Chinese female martial artist\n*[[Raidou (Dead or Alive)|Raidou]], an evil ninja exiled from Kasumi's clan\n*[[Ryu Hayabusa]], a Japanese ninja hero originally from \u0022[[Ninja Gaiden]]\u0022\n*[[Tina Armstrong]], an American female wrestler\n*[[Zack (Dead or Alive)|Zack]], a flamboyant African-American kickboxer\n\nAdded in the PlayStation and \u0022Arcade++\u0022 versions are Kasumi's half-sister [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]] and Tina's father [[Bass Armstrong]].\n\n===Story===\nA runaway [[kunoichi]] known as Kasumi enters the Dead o
