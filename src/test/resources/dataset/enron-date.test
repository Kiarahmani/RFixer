Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. @@Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)@@has been the only pipeline into this market.  @@@@@@NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis@@@@Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new @@47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois @@Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored @@by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will @@add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis @@market. @@@@"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing @@strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets @@currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by @@adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D. @@Kinder , CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. @@@@The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois @@Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is @@scheduled for completion in June of 2002. @@@@NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and @@storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective 
, @@which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In @@addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation @@agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf @@Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. @@@@The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area @@that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company @@[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer , @@president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system @@will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the @@metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point @@to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the @@area. @@@@"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy @@provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb @@Macdonald , president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest @@from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season @@will determine the final scope of the project. @@@@"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the @@St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of @@interest," said Macdonald . "We anticipate a strong response, however, given @@the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power @@generation." @@@@Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis , NGPL's director of business @@development, at (630) 691-3347.

"It won't require surgery, but he@@is@@out for this week and he's questionable for A&M."@@Brown said he is slightly optimistic because "I've had five kinee@@operations@@and I never was moving around  as good as Major was Saturday night after@@the@@game."@@But he said sophomore Chris Simms is the starting QB and will be backed up@@by@@Beau Trahan , with WR Courtnee Garcia , a former high school QB, also getting@@some snaps at QB just in case any additional injuries occur at the@@position.@@Brown said he has no plans to play freshman Chance Mock, who is@@redshirting,@@because he said Mock runs the opposing teams' offenses for the scout team@@against the Longhorn defense and hasn't worked with the first or second@@team@@offenses all year.@@"We think he is going to be a very good player, but we still plan to@@redshirt@@him this year," Brown said.@@I talked to a couple of friends who are outstanding knee surgeons and both@@said Applewhite will have a hard time returning in time for the A&M game.@@They said he would have a very difficult time backing up with a sprained@@PCL.@@Brown said it will be important for the offense to be two-dimensional@@against@@Kansas so all the pressure for moving the offense does not fall on Simms .@@Freshman DT Stevie Lee (broken bone in foot) won't be able to play Saturday@@at Kansas, Brown said, adding that it looks like Lee, who was injured in@@the@@third game, will not be able to play again this year and will be eligible@@for@@a medical redshirt that will give him four more years of eligibility. If a@@player is injured prior to the fourth game, he is eligible for a medical@@redshirt if he is unable to return later in the season.@@Brown said backup CB Ervis Hill has a separated shoulder and is out for the@@rest of the season. He also said backup WR Artie Ellis is still having@@problems with a sore shin and won't play Saturday.@@Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery last week and@@Brown said the doctors said it went well.@@* * * *@@The Longhorns are starting true freshmen at their three primary recever@@positions, and Brown said all three of them are playing well.

Johnson have been starting for several weeks and they@@already rank first (Williams ) and second (Johnson ) on the list of Longhorn@@freshmen receivers in yardage for a season. TE Brock Edwards moved up when@@Mike Jones hurt his knee, and Brown said Edwards , who got his second start@@Saturday at Texas Tech, "played really, really well. His blocking is much@@better and he made two outstanding catches." Williams has 544 yards in@@receptions this season and Johnson has 496. The previous freshman high was@@set by Lovell Pinkney , who had 458 receiving yards as a freshman in 1992.@@* * * *@@Brown said the Longhorns have been playing much better during their@@four-game@@winning streak, and he cited three primary reasons.

Dear Mr. Arora :@@@@I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past@@Wednesday.  I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company@@and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives@@Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.  Your responses to my@@questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.@@@@As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and@@Electronic Commerce.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in@@May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I@@received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge@@in August of 1995.@@@@After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as@@an analyst in its Financial Development Program.  Most recently, I worked as@@an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major@@business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44@@million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of@@Thomson's key competitors.  I also performed strategic, market, and@@competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's@@overall competitiveness.  My professional experiences working in the High@@Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a@@complete redefinition of my career goals.  I much prefer to be on the front@@lines of business, helping some of the world's most established@@organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and@@competitive position in the market.   I am anxious to begin my career with@@Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually@@beneficial.@@@@In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in@@Nashville.  If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at@@Ajay.Jagsi@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu or at (615) 673-0329.@@@@@@Have a wonderful week!@@@@@@Best Regards,@@@@@@@@@@@@Ajay S. Jagsi

You indicated that you had an idea @@that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 @@months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most @@aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired @@LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two @@weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation @@duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front @@of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work @@done.@@@@The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling @@requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of @@this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental @@installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not @@be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  @@@@I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think @@that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean @@getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. @@@@You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for @@Florida.

The Competition Bureau declined to comment on@@the status of the case.@@  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of@@provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny@@breaking any rules or laws.@@  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for@@high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.@@  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market@@design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow@@Jones Newswires in an interview.@@   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame@@  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every @@deregulating@@market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.@@  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even@@oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,@@there have been investigations done," Palmer said.@@  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets@@investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the@@first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.@@  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion@@is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.@@  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's @@status.@@Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard@@from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week@@with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode .@@  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers@@noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 @@with@@unusual frequency.@@  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power@@for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount@@of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes@@before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power@@needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to@@meet demand.@@   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed@@  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and@@Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:@@  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two @@minutes@@later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,@@but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.@@Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its@@offer.@@  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig , who once worked in Enron Canada's gas@@trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly@@Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to@@between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and@@10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.@@  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig , and then the Bureau's Bloom,@@concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the@@power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the@@higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume@@offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be@@needed, and every participant would get the higher price.@@  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by@@the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or@@that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.@@  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with @@Enron.@@There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a@@change in prices or anything like that."@@  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's@@risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,@@Peterson said.@@  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments @@of@@Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,@@Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced@@unit," according to the warrant application.@@  Peterson 's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we@@felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."@@  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.@@  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we@@could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other@@company does that's in the business of trading."@@  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, @@1999,@@and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,@@essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public@@its investigation into Powerex and Enron.@@  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the@@investigation.@@  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the@@interests and activities of market participants," he said.@@  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at@@the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't@@likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada@@"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to@@inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."@@  Companies Concerned About Reputations@@  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex@@reputation.@@  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at@@stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I@@believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are@@difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and@@California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a@@possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."@@  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of@@Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,@@linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market@@surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.@@@@  Company Web sites: http://www.powerex.com, http://www.enron.com@@@@  -By Cheryl Kim , Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; cheryl.kim@dowjones.com@@@@  (END) DOW JONES NEWS  11-21-00@@  03:31 PM- - 03 31 PM EST 11-21-00

Group,@@@@When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important @@guidelines to remember.@@@@IMPORT-This must be FIRM.  A firm import is required so that we provide the @@spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the @@import).  If the import is non-firm, California will charge us their price @@for spinning reserve margins.  This could easily be $400 per mw come this @@summer.@@@@@@EXPORT-This must be NON-FIRM.  A non-firm export allows us to provide @@spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy @@without spinning reserves as "non-firm"), and NOT have to pay the California @@price for spinning reserve margins.  Conversely if we do a firm export, we @@would have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves.  And because @@California will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, @@this could easily be $400 per mw this summer.@@California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a "firm" @@export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than @@nonfirm.@@@@IF you have other questions.

The following is the understanding I have with Chris Calger regarding Scott @@Healy 's involvement in East Power initiatives:@@@@Since Auburndale is effectively dead, Scott will no longer be involved on @@this project.@@Scott will support the Haywood, Georgia, & Calvert City development site @@sales through Q1 2001, with East Power getting 100% of the P&L value and @@Scott Healy getting personal performance credit.   If Ben elects to continue @@to use Scott 's services beyond Q1 2001, a value sharing agreement between @@Ben , Calger and myself will have to be agreed upon.@@Jeff Ader will make a decision (after consultation with me) as to Scott 's @@continued involvement on the fuel cell tax monetization and Dighton @@restructuring project.   If Jeff makes the decision that Scott needs to @@remain actively involved in order to close the transaction, a value sharing @@agreement will be made between Jeff , Calger , and myself.    The value @@allocation % will be agreed upon upfront within the next week.   If a fair @@value sharing agreement cannot be reached, Jeff will transition @@responsibility to another member of his origination team.@@@@Chris - Do you agree with the above description?
I sent this info as discussed to Karen last week who prepared spreadsheet for @@Lavo.  I think the question now is how many and what will be the placement.  @@I also have identified several needs for Summer Interns in Fundamentals and @@Realtime.  Lloyd Will went through the resume book to pick summer interns for @@Fundamentals (provided you concur)  and the plan was to have Rika use them @@for analytical work during the summer backfilling them with Strong AA's from @@the Fall group if needed.  Juan Hernandez called me regarding adding a summer @@intern or two for the nightshift for confirmations etc. Just to let you know, @@I developed a spreadsheet with the help of Lloyd and Tom May outlining the @@entire Power team to track all our openings and help us orchestrate the @@movement of employees through power so the groups won't struggle with being @@short. This also will help all of our recruiters Johnny , Charles , Karen @@Buckley and the program folks stay focused on our needs.@@@@ -----Original Message-----@@From:  Presto, Kevin Sent: Thursday,
 2:44 PM@@To: Lavorato, John ; Buckley, Karen Cc: Melodick, Kim Subject: Assoc./Analysts@@@@I would like 6 Analysts and 4 Associates.   I provided my top 20 wish list to @@Lavo last week.@@@@Thanks.
Detailed below are the project teams identified in yesterday's meeting.  We @@would like to run these by Greg asap to begin pulling them together and @@wanted to run this current list by each of you.  We specifically wanted to @@make sure that you felt we would only be requiring Greg to go get Deirdre , @@Heather , Jim and Kristen from other business units.@@@@Please let us know by the end of today if you have any additions or deletions @@to this list.@@@@Thanks@@@@Wade 
Since I did not get a chance to meet with you yesterday, I would like to lay @@out a few thoughts in this email:@@@@1. Additional areas that might require immediate attention:@@@@? Consider existing "Bets" and large positions already in the books and ways @@of adjusting these bets, if necessary (excluding CA):@@  - NY: large short positions behind Central Hudson and ConEd (IBM deal and @@others)@@  - Carolinas: Standard Offer timing (Springs, Eli Lily , others)@@  - Illinois: concentration of short regulated positions@@@@? Quick handle on option positions: do we need to switch customers in some @@areas? what options we ought to exercise tomorrow? next week? etc.@@  - options embedded in the deals@@  - regulatory switch options@@  - retail index options@@  - EAM options@@@@? Managing value from restructuring legacy deals: in the process of reviewing @@the 13 deals, we discovered some provisions in the contracts that were not @@captured and managed properly - they might require immediate attention to @@minimize losses in these deals.@@@@2. Managing Regulatory Exposure@@@@? Approximately 80% of EES regulatory exposure is behind 40 utilities@@? In the process of rate case decomposition, we need to identify the main @@components of each rate structure - create a rate case formula@@? These components will fall into two categories: hedgeable (gas, coal, @@heating oil fuel costs, inflation, etc.) and "unhedgeable" (CTC timing, @@standard offer, etc.)@@@@  Hedgeable Component      Unhedgeable Component@@Strategy: Manage within the respective commodity books   Capitalize on @@portfolio diversification across the country@@          Look for "macro" hedges and focus activities of EGA@@@@Pricing:  You know best       Risk-based: higher premiums for greater @@uncertainty@@@@Policy:  Internal authorizations only on who, how and when to hedge Develop a @@limit framework and propose a limit to the BOD@@@@Exposure: Existing VaR model will suffice     Develop and implement stress @@scenarios to quantify exposure@@@@3. Other Considerations@@@@? Curve management: clear responsibilities, periodic review and validation@@? Interaction with the EAM world: EAM projects create long positions, pricing @@bundled deals with an EAM component@@? Flash-to-actual catch up: liquidations validate curve assumptions@@? Attention to EES-Canada: currently executed a power deal and a few gas deals@@? Process for pricing smaller mid-market deals: sacrificing quantity for @@quality - force originators to develop standard deal structures@@@@I could elaborate further on these points. Vlady .

(PG&E), in filings with the California Public=20@@Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20@@(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases=@@=20@@in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20@@cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20@@In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent=@@=20@@company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN=@@),=20@@a ratepayer advocacy group.@@@@ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale=@@=20@@market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20@@Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded=20@@costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers=20@@were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20@@due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E=20@@customers=20@@were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not=20@@paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.@@@@Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20@@PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul=@@t=20@@is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7=@@=20@@billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been=20@@unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20@@terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20@@market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers=@@=20@@on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7=20@@billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount=@@=20@@is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's=@@=20@@motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20@@rates in California.@@@@However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as=@@=20@@other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of=@@f=20@@deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20@@plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa=@@le=20@@market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities=@@=01*@@the=20@@ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20@@assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit=@@ion,=20@@PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing=@@=20@@very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in=@@=20@@markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20@@New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte=@@r.=20@@Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,=@@=20@@PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not=@@=20@@support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other=@@=20@@states.@@@@PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20@@revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20@@year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20@@PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20@@shareholders=20@@that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that=@@=20@@it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators=20@@that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay=@@=20@@for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come=20@@anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20@@to its obligation of serving customers.@@@@PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end 
, at the very latest,=@@=20@@or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,=@@=20@@something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20@@to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the=@@=20@@utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs=@@=20@@are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E=@@=20@@will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20@@it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20@@a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20@@proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over=20@@its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted=@@.=20@@PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based=@@=20@@on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its=20@@stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.@@@@It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed=@@=20@@the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20@@and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most=@@=20@@issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20@@to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20@@TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20@@rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20@@from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20@@proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20@@possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer=@@s.@@@@Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20@@on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20@@have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation=@@=20@@in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'=@@s=20@@proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20@@to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has=20@@very clearly stated that its proposal is a "necessary short-term step to=20@@try to bring prices back in line." PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe=@@d=20@@as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel=@@y=20@@attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20@@temporary=20@@lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20@@transfer=20@@its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati=@@on=20@@via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it=20@@continues=20@@to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes=@@=20@@that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20@@power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo=@@my=20@@of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20@@California.=20@@As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for=20@@power.=20@@@@PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi=@@ng=20@@else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous=20@@economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A=20@@recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu=@@e=20@@to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20@@"technically=20@@insolvent" sometime next year.

The information is not to be used at any time other than for the@@purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to@@acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use@@information it has previously received for unintended purposes.

Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,@@punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many@@damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct@@or ordinary, but rather consequential.

 TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power Contract <UNS.N>@@@@TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power@@Contract@@   TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
--Tucson Electric@@Power Co. (TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60@@megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.@@   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply@@the power at all times except during the company's peak customer@@energy demand periods from July through September of each year.@@   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.@@Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.@@"This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans@@ahead for its energy needs," Pignatelli said. "And for TEP, the@@contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a@@solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market."@@   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate@@revenues of about $30 million annually.@@   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power@@at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under@@the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge@@if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating@@resources.@@   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and@@molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.@@   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.@@(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric@@utility.@@   TEP Public Affairs@@   P.O.

It may want to@@> unload the carpet spinning or apparel fiber business . . . but not the@@> associated intermediates production.@@>@@> NYLON'S WEAK LINKS ARE INDUSTRIAL (PART) AND APPAREL: THE LATTER HAS NO@@> EASY FIX.@@>@@> 1)IN OUR VIEW, STAYING IN APPAREL nylon will be painful. DD HAS SAID IT@@> WILL RELATIVELY DE-EMPHASIZE THE BUSINESS (in the long run such a@@strategy@@> is tough to implement without impairing the business . . . better to@@> exit). Witness what happened to the polyester chain where disposition is@@coming a@@> decade late in the minds of some . . . at little value. Meanwhile,@@> competitive advantage is eroding slowly. i)Maturity allows others to@@close@@> the gap. ii)Customers have gotten stronger, especially in carpet (45% of@@> div revenue). Several years can go buy waiting for recovery. Unfavorable@@> volume and raw material costs are hurting near term. Growth slowed down@@> some time back. Its unlikely to resume. Industry mix continues to shift@@> slowly towards Nylon 6 in which DD is a tiny regional player, vs Nylon@@66.@@> Further, growth is in Asia, not a DuPont strong hold.@@>@@> 2)BACKING OUT OF APPAREL (OR CARPET) WILL BE TRICKY. (It's not even clear@@> DuPont is serous about this option). In any event, it will be difficult@@to@@> find buyers for just the fiber SPINNING operation, if they will need to@@> buy raw materials from duPont. Further, nylon does provide critical mass@@to@@> the large apparel effort, picking up cost allocations that otherwise may@@need@@> to be shouldered by Lycra! Another problem: All nylon producers seem to@@> want to exit the fiber spinning step . . . Solutia, Honeywell, DuPont.@@> Makes one wonder about the potential disposition value!@@>@@> 3)SHUTTING DOWN IS NOT AN OPTION: There is incremental profit in the@@> intermediate step and that would be lost. A)Apparel is nearly 25% of the@@> nylon polymer outlet and without it the scale of operations is hurt.@@> B)Apparel nylon is a very large part of duPont's apparel business, which,@@> after automotive, is the largest end market.@@>@@> Likewise, engineered polymers make up a large part of the nylon family@@> (though DD books revenue and profit for these under its@@coatings/polymers)@@> segment. Shrinking 'the rest of nylon' would hurt profitability of the@@> engineered plastics area. The rest of nylon picks up overhead!@@>@@> DuPont seems to be forced to keep a large chunk of nylon because of its@@> presence in Engineered plastics and Lycra.@@>@@> i)Lycra is largely an apparel business. The $1.65 bn Lycra has been a@@high@@> margin business. It's growth has slowed and competitive position is@@> slipping. Yet DD is increasing its commitment to Lycra. The problem is@@> that the Lycra franchise encourages a greater commitment to apparel nylon@@than@@> otherwise. Apparel nylon is 25% of the nylon div revenue.@@>@@> ii)The $2 bn engineered plastics business has nylon resin as its@@flagship.@@> This is NOT included in the nylon division. (Likewise, polyester@@> engineered plastic is not included in the polyester div). Part of the@@competitive@@> advantage in the plastic comes from a low cost position in raw materials,@@> in turn partly based on scale.@@>@@> iii)DD seems to like its nylon ingredients business. (In our view it's@@ok,@@> not a growth vehicle). The combination of the interest in Lycra, nylon@@> intermediates and engineered plastics means DD is forced to keep nylon@@> carpet (45% of div) and apparel (25%). These end markets don't make as@@> much money and are more vulnerable. But they provide over 60% of the@@outlet for@@> the intermediates and their sheer volume helps provide greater scale and@@> lower cost.@@>@@> SO THE NYLON PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED.@@> 1)ROC has been poor.
